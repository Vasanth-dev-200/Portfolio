        "Roriri 5050 is a thoughtfully developed platform aimed at engaging students in tech-related events and providing an interactive and rewarding experience. This project allows students to register for various technology-based events and actively participate, earning points as they do so. The platform is designed to motivate and encourage students to engage in these activities by introducing a point-based system. Each time a student participates in an event, they accumulate points based on their level of involvement. These points are stored and tracked in real-time, ensuring that students are always aware of their progress. Furthermore, the system includes an exciting rewards redemption feature, where students can use their earned points to claim prizes and incentives. To ensure a secure and seamless user experience, user authentication and authorization mechanisms have been implemented, providing an extra layer of security for the registration and participation processes. This feature guarantees that only authorized users can access event details, register, and track their points, ensuring a safe and reliable system.",
